# Implementation of Lasso Mixture of Linear Regressions model in C++
# -------------------------------------------------

This repository contains an implementation of the methodology outlined in 

Lloyd-Jones, Luke R., Hien D. Nguyen, and Geoffrey J. McLachlan. "A globally 
convergent algorithm for lasso-penalized mixture of linear regression models." 
Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 119 (2018): 19-38.

More details about the program and its use can be found in the manual.
