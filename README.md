# Implementation of Lasso Mixture of Linear Regressions model in C++
# -------------------------------------------------

This repository contains an implementation of the methodology outlined in Luke R. Lloyd-Jones, 
Hien D. Nguyen, Geoffrey J. McLachlan. "A globally convergent algorithm for lasso-penalized 
mixture of linear regression models". arXiv (2016):1603.08326 (2016). More details about the
program and its use can be found in the manual.
